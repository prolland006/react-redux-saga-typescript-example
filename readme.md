# Steps

Change directory to _./frontend_ and execute:

npm install
```

Change directory to _./backend_ and execute:

```bash
npm install
```


- Let's run the server side project.

Change directory to _./backend_ and execute:

```
npm start

- Now we will change directory to front end and start working on that.

First we will launch our socket backend (if we don't have it alreay running)..

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Now let's launch the front end:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
